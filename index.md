# Deerhub

- The idea for Deerhub started with a project for the Wallace Deer Management Association.
- WDMA is a group of hunters in Wallace Township, Pennsylvania.
- Many of the township properties are over-run with white-tail deer.
- We developed the WDMA website to help hunters and property owners coordinate hunting, safely.
